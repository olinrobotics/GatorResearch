      <!-- The best practice for including new sensors in robot_localization's state estimation nodes is to pass in velocity
           measurements and let the nodes integrate them. However, this isn't always feasible, and so the state estimation
           nodes support fusion of absolute measurements. If you have more than one sensor providing absolute measurements,
           however, you may run into problems if your covariances are not large enough, as the sensors will inevitably
           diverge from one another, causing the filter to jump back and forth rapidly. To combat this situation, you can
           either increase the covariances for the variables in question, or you can simply set the sensor's differential
           parameter to true. When differential mode is enabled, all absolute pose data is converted to velocity data by
           differentiating the absolute pose measurements. These velocities are then integrated as usual. NOTE: this only
           applies to sensors that provide absolute measurements, so setting differential to true for twit measurements has
           no effect.

           Users should take care when setting this to true for orientation variables: if you have only one source of
           absolute orientation data, you should not set the differential parameter to true. This is due to the fact that
           integration of velocities leads to slowly increasing error in the absolute (pose) variable. For position variables,
           this is acceptable. For orientation variables, it can lead to trouble. Users should make sure that all orientation
           variables have at least one source of absolute measurement. -->

           that the relative parameter doesn't cause the measurement to be converted to a velocity before integrating it. If
           you simply want your measurements to start at 0 for a given sensor, set this to true. -->
